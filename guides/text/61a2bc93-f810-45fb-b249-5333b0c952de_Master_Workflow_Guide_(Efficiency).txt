(Efficiency)
Company Workflow & Culture Guide
This is our updated structure for project ownership, scheduling, and 
communication. 
This was written to tackle the issue of creative work & collaboration across 
multiple projects remotely. A lack of defined responsibilities, work-hours, breaks 
and socialising breaks has led to efficiency becoming problematic. The idea here 
is to try and define what is expected of everyone day-to-day, and figure out how 
to make remote, focused, deep-work still feel social and fun!
Terms:
Junior: Freelancers paid per-project.
Senior: Full-time employee owning projects.

Manager: Full-time employee overseeing systems & progress, big picture 
coordination.

Project Ownership & Roles
Seniors
Own one project at a time (bodycam) or work under Lead on main channel 
(but still on 1 project only).
Avoid switching tasks unless directed by a lead.
Responsible for finishing and driving their projects.
Required to do at least 1 peer review per week (reviewing another seniors 
video before A/A/A review.
Leads
Provide final reviews and ensure overall quality.
Master Workflow Guide Efficiency)2

Only step into second channel videos when assigned (or no projects on main 
channel).
If Lead has no main channel work, provide Harald with a detailed plan for 
bodycam video, including dates and timeline.
If main channel work, provide detailed plan including:
Timeline
Which juniors are assigned to own project
Their own tasks for project
When not assigned to a main channel video, lead should hands-on help on the 
most promising bodycam video under Aminoʼs supervision. 
Juniors (Freelancers)
Work only on directly assigned tasks.
All feedback from Amino (for second channel).
Amino
Oversees all bodycam video production.
Directly supervises paid-per-video freelancers.

Peer reviews: Senior Cross-Review System
After a draft is done, assign it to another senior for review. This is before A/A/A 
review.
Then it goes to a Lead for final review.
This builds skill amongst seniors: Being able to accurately review videos & 
understand their own shortcomings. Helps take extra review time off A/A/A.
Collaboration Protocol
Collaboration is great, but as of late it has led to overwhelming tasks, distractions 
and lower efficiency. We need more defined tasks each person OWNS, and thatʼs 
their only major worry. 
If you need help from someone (e.g. Amino needs Ayoub), write the task 
down unless itʼs truly urgent, then bring it up during FIKA break.
This does not include Dreams / Shadew, you can always contact them as 
they have “floatingˮ roles.
If it can't wait until the fika break, and you're blocked from continuing work, 
then itʼs okay to contact colleague instantly.
If it's still not resolved, bring it up again during the wrap-up meeting to 
coordinate action steps.
This avoids sporadic interruptions and supports deep work.
Accountability & Expectations
Be on time. Even 10 minutes late must be reported in Discord General chat. If 
more than 30 min, add to “Gonerʼsˮ c alendar in Notion.
Other than that, this hasnʼt been a big issue, just clarifying. This is more so to 
introduce clear accountability for FOIA team.
