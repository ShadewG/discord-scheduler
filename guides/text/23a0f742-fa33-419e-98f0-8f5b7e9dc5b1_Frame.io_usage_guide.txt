 Finding the Right Project Space
 After logging in, on the left-hand side, you'll see a dropdown for “Matcher 
Mediaˮ.
 Inside that, locate the Insanity Bodycam category — this is where all drafts 
will be uploaded.
 Projects are labeled as 
BC[number]
 (e.g., 
BC28
, 
BC31
).
 Uploading Your Draft
 Navigate to the appropriate project (
BC[number]
) or create a new one:
Right-click inside the Insanity Bodycam section and select New Folder.
Name the folder using the format: 
BC[number]
 (e.g., 
BC35
).
 Inside that folder, upload your draft using the correct file naming convention 
(critical for team clarity):
 File Naming Format:

 Using Version Stacks
Version Stacks keep all versions of a video grouped in one place.
To add to a version stack:
Drag and drop your new version on top of the existing video in Frame.io.
This will automatically create a version stack (
V1
, 
V2
, etc.).
Youʼll be able to toggle between versions and review previous notes in one 
timeline.
Why it's important:
This helps lead editors track changes easily, compare revisions, and avoid 
confusion.
 Handling Notes
When a lead editor leaves notes:
 Review each time-stamped comment carefully.
 After addressing and amending a note, mark it as complete:
Open the video → look to the right-hand comments panel.
Click the small circle icon in the top right of the comment to mark it as 
complete ✅.
Important:
Do not ignore notes or assume you've interpreted them correctly if you're 
unsure.
If something is unclear, ask on Discord! It's always better to ask than to guess.
易 Best Practices
Always double-check filenames and folder structure before uploading.
Frame.io Usage Guide2

Keep version stacks clean — donʼt upload versions as separate files unless 
instructed.
Donʼt forget to check off notes as you complete them — this is crucial for 
keeping workflows clear for senior editors.
Stay communicative. If you're unclear on a note or expectation, post in the 
project Discord thread.
If you have questions, ask early, ask often. Weʼre all here to help you succeed.
