A lack of defined responsibilities, work-hours, breaks \nand socialising breaks has led to efficiency becoming problematic. The idea here \nis to try and define what is expected of everyone day-to-day, and figure out how \nto make remote, focused, deep-work still feel social and fun!\nTerms:\nJunior: Freelancers paid per-project.\nSenior: Full-time employee owning projects.\nLead: Full-time employee overseeing & leading owned projects.\nManager: Full-time employee overseeing systems & progress, big picture \ncoordination.\nDaily Schedule (Berlin Time)\nTimeActivityGoal\n08550900Get ready to join!\nMaster Workflow Guide Efficiency)1\n\n09000920\nSocial \"Fika\" (casual check-in\n+ sync)\nEvery morning, at precisely 900, we join\ncall together and talk about our plans for\nthe day.\n09201100Deep Work\nFocused, uninterrupted work on our own\nprojects.\n11001120Fika BreakQuick update on progress, chat.\n11201300Deep Work (cont.)\nContinued focused work.

Peer\nreviews.\nMaster Workflow Guide Efficiency)3\n\nPeer reviews: Senior Cross-Review System\nAfter a draft is done, assign it to another senior for review. This is before A/A/A \nreview.\nThen it goes to a Lead for final review.\nThis builds skill amongst seniors: Being able to accurately review videos & \nunderstand their own shortcomings. Helps take extra review time off A/A/A.\nCollaboration Protocol\nCollaboration is great, but as of late it has led to overwhelming tasks, distractions \nand lower efficiency. We need more defined tasks each person OWNS, and thatʼs \ntheir only major worry. \nIf you need help from someone (e.g. Amino needs Ayoub), write the task \ndown unless itʼs truly urgent, then bring it up during FIKA break.\nThis does not include Dreams / Shadew, you can always contact them as \nthey have “floatingˮ roles.\nIf it can't wait until the fika break, and you're blocked from continuing work, \nthen itʼs okay to contact colleague instantly.\nIf it's still not resolved, bring it up again during the wrap-up meeting to \ncoordinate action steps.\nThis avoids sporadic interruptions and supports deep work.\nAccountability & Expectations\nBe on time. Even 10 minutes late must be reported in Discord General chat. If \nmore than 30 min, add to “Gonerʼsˮ c alendar in Notion.\nOther than that, this hasnʼt been a big issue, just clarifying. This is more so to \nintroduce clear accountability for FOIA team.\nMaster Workflow Guide Efficiency)4\n\nHours:\nNameBerlin Time\nArmin9001730\nAmin7001530\nAyoub9001730\nJokubas9001730\nDominik9001730\nYovcho9001730\nAustin14302300\nNicholas Rice Dreams)1700  2300\nGo back and review schedule now that full context is given.\n Before EOD, everyone write up their own responsibilities in detail — and what \ntype of responsibilities they think they could handle...\n Clean-write notes  DM Harald your notes\n Get a web cam bro\n \nMaster Workflow Guide Efficiency)5"
