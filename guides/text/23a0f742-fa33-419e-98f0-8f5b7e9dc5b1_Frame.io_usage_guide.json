It's always better to ask than to guess.\n易 Best Practices\nAlways double-check filenames and folder structure before uploading.\nFrame.io Usage Guide2\n\nKeep version stacks clean — donʼt upload versions as separate files unless \ninstructed.\nDonʼt forget to check off notes as you complete them — this is crucial for \nkeeping workflows clear for senior editors.\nStay communicative. If you're unclear on a note or expectation, post in the \nproject Discord thread.\nIf you have questions, ask early, ask often. Weʼre all here to help you succeed.\nFrame.io Usage Guide3"
