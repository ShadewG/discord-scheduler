Guide to Creating 3D-Rendered AI-
Generated Scenes
Overview:
This guide walks you through the process of creating 3D-rendered AI-generated 
scenes for video content. Follow the pipeline from image generation to final post-
processing.
1. Generating the Image
Objective:
Create a simple 3D-rendered image using the AI Image Generator.
Steps:
 Go to the Projects tab on the left-hand side of Notion.
 Select 3D Generator.
 Click on Generate a Prompt at the top.
 Tip: Keep your prompt simple. Avoid overly complex scenes for easier 
conversion into video. Focus on simplicity to achieve a more natural look.
 Once satisfied with the generated image, download it to your computer.
2. Importing the Image into Runway
Objective:
Import the image into Runway and generate a 510 second video with subtle 
camera movements.
Steps:
3D AI Scenes Workflow1

 Open Runway and navigate to the Generate Video tab on the left-hand side.
 Upload your image when prompted.
 Crop the image to a 169 aspect ratio.
 Add Camera Movement Prompt: Describe the desired camera movement:
Examples:
Slow pan to the left
Slow dolly in
Camera orbit around statues
 Important: Specify that the scene features statues or state “no movementˮ if 
you want the objects to remain still.
 Click on Generate the Video.
3. Upscaling the Video with Topaz AI
Objective:
Upscale the 720p video to a higher resolution 1080p or 2K.
Steps:
 Once the video is generated, export it at 720p.
 Open Topaz Video AI to upscale the video:
Choose between 1080p or 2K resolution.
 Note: Specific settings for Topaz AI will be provided later in the guide, 
detailing which models and settings to use.
4. Post-Processing in After Effects
Objective:
Enhance the scene with post-processing techniques for better realism and quality.
Steps:
 Import your video into After Effects.
3D AI Scenes Workflow2

 Apply the post-processing template provided.
 Generate a Depth Map:
Option 1 Use the Depth Scanner plugin in After Effects (recommended for 
better results).
Option 2 Upload your video back to Runway to extract a depth map.
 Note: Depth Scanner can be slower on certain GPUs but is preferred for its 
quality.
5. Final Adjustments & Rendering
Objective:
Make final tweaks to the scene and render it for final use.
Steps:
 Adjust the depth map, colors, or any additional effects as needed.
 Render the final video in the desired output format.
6. Additional Notes & Work in Progress
Some sections of the guide are still being finalized, including:
Topaz AI settings
Post-processing templates for After Effects
Updates will be added as more information becomes available.
Notion Specific Formatting Tips:
Use headings H1, H2, H3 for main sections.
Use toggle lists for expandable sections like Steps or Notes.
Organize to-do lists for the actionable steps that are still in progress (like 
Topaz settings or templates).
