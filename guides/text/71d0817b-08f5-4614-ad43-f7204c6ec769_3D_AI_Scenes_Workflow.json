Follow the pipeline from image generation to final post-\nprocessing.\n1. Generating the Image\nObjective:\nCreate a simple 3D-rendered image using the AI Image Generator.\nSteps:\n Go to the Projects tab on the left-hand side of Notion.\n Select 3D Generator.\n Click on Generate a Prompt at the top.\n Tip: Keep your prompt simple. Avoid overly complex scenes for easier \nconversion into video. Focus on simplicity to achieve a more natural look.\n Once satisfied with the generated image, download it to your computer.\n2. Importing the Image into Runway\nObjective:\nImport the image into Runway and generate a 510 second video with subtle \ncamera movements.\nSteps:\n3D AI Scenes Workflow1\n\n Open Runway and navigate to the Generate Video tab on the left-hand side.\n Upload your image when prompted.\n Crop the image to a 169 aspect ratio.\n Add Camera Movement Prompt: Describe the desired camera movement:\nExamples:\nSlow pan to the left\nSlow dolly in\nCamera orbit around statues\n Important: Specify that the scene features statues or state “no movementˮ if \nyou want the objects to remain still.\n Click on Generate the Video.\n3. Upscaling the Video with Topaz AI\nObjective:\nUpscale the 720p video to a higher resolution 1080p or 2K.\nSteps:\n Once the video is generated, export it at 720p.\n Open Topaz Video AI to upscale the video:\nChoose between 1080p or 2K resolution.\n Note: Specific settings for Topaz AI will be provided later in the guide, \ndetailing which models and settings to use.\n4. Post-Processing in After Effects\nObjective:\nEnhance the scene with post-processing techniques for better realism and quality.\nSteps:\n Import your video into After Effects.\n3D AI Scenes Workflow2\n\n Apply the post-processing template provided.\n Generate a Depth Map:\nOption 1 Use the Depth Scanner plugin in After Effects (recommended for \nbetter results).\nOption 2 Upload your video back to Runway to extract a depth map.\n Note: Depth Scanner can be slower on certain GPUs but is preferred for its \nquality.\n5. Final Adjustments & Rendering\nObjective:\nMake final tweaks to the scene and render it for final use.\nSteps:\n Adjust the depth map, colors, or any additional effects as needed.\n Render the final video in the desired output format.\n6. Additional Notes & Work in Progress\nSome sections of the guide are still being finalized, including:\nTopaz AI settings\nPost-processing templates for After Effects\nUpdates will be added as more information becomes available.\nNotion Specific Formatting Tips:\nUse headings H1, H2, H3 for main sections.\nUse toggle lists for expandable sections like Steps or Notes.\nOrganize to-do lists for the actionable steps that are still in progress (like \nTopaz settings or templates).\n3D AI Scenes Workflow3\n\nAdd links to relevant projects or templates where needed (e.g., linking directly \nto the 3D Generator or Runway tools).\n3D AI Scenes Workflow4"
